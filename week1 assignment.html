            <h3>Warranty Claim Fraud Detection DataAnalysis</h3>
            <p>In this research, we showcase the application of analytics in aiding 
                manufacturers to identify fraudulent activities within their warranty claims 
                information. Conventional approaches to processing claims involve manual 
                assessment by an auditor adhering to predefined rules. Through the utilization 
                of analytics, this procedure is automated, allowing technology to uncover 
                intricate data patterns imperceptible to an individual. Examples of fraud 
                instances where analytics proves valuable encompass:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> Fabricated clients and/or claims</li>
                    <li>Duplicate charging for replaced components</li> 
                    <li>Superfluous or unwarranted repairs/part replacements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is important to note that while analytics is not designed to supplant the 
                    existing claims processing system, it should serve as a secondary review 
                    mechanism to uncover atypical patterns and suspicious connections indicative 
                    of potential fraud</p>
